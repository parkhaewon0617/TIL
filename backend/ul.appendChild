'li.appendChild'

In the provided code, `ul.appendChild` and `li.appendChild` are methods used to append child elements to a parent element in the Document Object Model (DOM) of a webpage. Here's a detailed explanation of the role they play and how they are used in this code:

### `ul.appendChild`

The method `ul.appendChild(childElement)` is used to append a child element to the end of the list of children of a specified parent element.

#### Role in the Code

- **Purpose**: It is used to add a new `<li>` element (representing a memo) to the `<ul>` element (the unordered list that holds all memo items).

- **Context in Code**:
  ```javascript
  ul.appendChild(li);
  ```
  - `ul` is a reference to the `<ul>` element with the id `memo-ul` that contains the list of memos.
  - `li` is the newly created `<li>` element that represents a single memo item, which includes the memo content, an edit button, and a delete button.

By calling `ul.appendChild(li)`, the code adds the new memo item to the list, ensuring it is displayed on the webpage.

### `li.appendChild`

The method `li.appendChild(childElement)` is used to append a child element to the end of the list of children of a specified parent element.

#### Role in the Code

- **Purpose**: It is used to add child elements (such as buttons) to the newly created `<li>` element that represents a memo.

- **Context in Code**:
  ```javascript
  li.appendChild(editBtn);
  li.appendChild(delBtn);
  ```
  - `li` is the `<li>` element representing a single memo item.
  - `editBtn` is the button element for editing the memo.
  - `delBtn` is the button element for deleting the memo.

By calling `li.appendChild(editBtn)` and `li.appendChild(delBtn)`, the code adds the edit and delete buttons to the memo item, making them functional and visible to the user.

### Summary of Concepts and Their Roles

- **`ul` (Unordered List)**: A HTML element that holds a collection of `<li>` elements. In this code, it serves as the container for all memo items.
- **`li` (List Item)**: A HTML element that represents an individual item within a list. In this code, it represents a single memo item, containing the memo content and buttons for editing and deleting.
- **`ul.appendChild(li)`**: Adds the newly created memo item to the list of memos displayed on the webpage.
- **`li.appendChild(editBtn)` and `li.appendChild(delBtn)`**: Add the edit and delete buttons to the memo item, enabling the user to interact with each memo.

These methods are crucial for dynamically updating the DOM, allowing the memo list to be created, displayed, and manipulated based on user actions and interactions.
